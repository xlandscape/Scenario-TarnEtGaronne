## About the project
A circular landscape digitization in Tarn-et-Garonne (France) intended for bee forage modelling.
This is an automatically generated documentation based on the available scenario metadata. The current version of this 
document is from 2022-03-25.

### Built with
The scenario can be used in the following Landscape Models:
* xBeeForage version 1.0 and higher


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

### Installation
Copy the complete scenario folder unaltered into the `scenario` subdirectory of your model. Reference the scenario
from the model parameterization. For details how to reference the scenario from the user parameterization, see the 
`README` of the model.


## Usage
The scenario adds the following macros to the Landscape Model:
* `:LandscapeScenario` (version 0.4)

### Roadmap
